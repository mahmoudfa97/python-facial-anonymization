# python-facial-anonymization
A Python script for video processing that anonymizes a person's face by applying a black mask to the forehead, eyebrows, and eyes. The tool uses computer vision techniques to detect faces, identify facial landmarks, and create a precise mask that follows facial features throughout the video.
